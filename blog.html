    <h2>1) What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h2>
    <p>Answer: DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface used in web documents.
It is used to represent the page so that programs can use it to change the document structure, style, and content.</p>

        <h2>2) How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.</h2>
        <p>Answer: To select HTML elements we use DOM selectors. The DOM methods are :
getElementsByTagName(),
getElementsByClassName(),
getElementById(),
querySelector() and
querySelectorAll()</p>

            <h2>3) What is event bubble?</h2>
            <p>Answer: Answer:Event Bubble is a concept in the DOM (Document Object Model). Where an element receives an event
 which bubbles up to its parent and ancestor elements in the DOM tree until it gets to the root element.
 It is a process that starts with the element that has triggered the event and then it bubbles up to the
  elements containing in the hierarchy. Here the event is first captured and handled by the
 innermost element and then it is propagated to outer elements.</p>
    
                <h2>4) What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h2>
                <p>Answer: A callback function is a function which is passed as an argument to another function. I will use callback
 functions because it makes sure that a function is not going to run before a task is completed 
rather it will run right after the task has completed. So we can specify a function when to run so
 we can develop asynchronous JavaScript code which is free from problems and errors.</p>
